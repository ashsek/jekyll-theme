## Introduction
I am a first year undergraduate student studying <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b> at National Institute of Technology Rourkela.I am Intrested in Python development and easily adaptable to other programming languages.

Being a first year, I may not have all the relevant skills and experience that you require from me but I am an extremely motivated programmer.I can learn new things easily and can adapt to new environments with an ease.

The best thing about me is that if I am given a new thing, I want to learn more about it by exploring.Having all the skills but not having the will to learn new things is worth nothing and I know that my will to learn and perform will never go away.
